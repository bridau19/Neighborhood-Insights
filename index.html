      <p style="width:25%;">During the month of October 2020, I worked on a photojournalism project exploring a particular neighborhood in the city. Having just moved to Chinatown, Manhattan a month prior, I wanted to explore more of my new neighborhood. After some initial research, I became intrigued by a particular throughway called Doyers Street, just a ten minute walk away from home. It is a small street that made up the heart of Chinatown a little over a century ago, and it has a rich and violent history that drew me in and made me want to return again and again. . .</p>
