          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Doyers Street is an unassuming 200-foot-long street that winds from Chatham Square to Pell Street in Manhattan’s Chinatown. It is a crooked little path with one or two bends and turns that seem out of place among Manhattan’s streamlined grid system of long, uninterrupted streets that stretch up and down the city. The street is named after a Dutch immigrant named Hendrick Doyer, who purchased the land there in 1793 to set up a distillery where he made Geneva, a popular Dutch gin made of juniper berries.</p>
          <p>At first glance, Doyers does not seem very interesting. Several barber shops, offices, and restaurants line the street, with an ugly gray U.S. post office at the end near Chatham Square. The storefronts are old and worn down, with little to no heritage architecture to be seen. However, there is more to the street than meets the eye--its violent and turbulent past led it to be dubbed “The Bloody Angle” in history books and newspaper articles dating back to the height of its fame.</p>

      <p>During the 19th century, Chinese immigration to the United States increased rapidly, stoking fears that Chinese immigrants would threaten American culture and employment. As snti-Chinese sentiment grew, backed by the government passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, Chinese communities responded with the formation of associations called tongs. Tongs typically focused on economic protection within a community. They worked to address the needs and services denied to Chinese people by local and federal government due to widespread discrimination, providing protection for their members, legal assistance, and help finding employment. Tongs historically came to be known as the gangs of Chinatown due to violence that ensued when different tongs fought one another for power during tong wars. Tongs continued to influence Chinatowns across America through to the 20th century, until legislative changes and shifting perspectives led to systemic and cultural improvements for Chinese immigrants. </p>

      <p>Doyers Street in particular is famous for its tong wars of the early 20th century. It is one of the oldest streets in Manhattan’s Chinatown--it formed most of Chinatown along with Pells and Mott street in the mid-1800s.The sharp bends in the narrow pathways of the street provided the perfect environment for ambushing members of rival tongs, and the street is still considered to hold the record for most recorded murders on a street in a single year with over 350 deaths, earning it the title of “Murder Alley” along with the “Bloody Angle.” Due to the dozens of barbershops and hairdressers that now reside there, some have re-nicknamed the street “Barber’s Alley.”</p>
      <p>Back then, secret passageways crisscrossed beneath the street, allowing the tongs who controlled them to make a fast escape after a violent crime. Today, the tunnels have been blocked off and occupied by modern businesses whose owners have to repeadedly deflect questions from prying tourists and historians who are curious about the ancient tunnels.</p>

      <p>A book called The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld (1928) by Herbert Asbury chronicles the descent of Doyers street into murder and chaos. During the late 19th century, a Cantonese man named Wah Kee ran a gambling and opium den above his small general store on 13 Pell Street, sparking a string of hundreds of gambling games and opium dens to surface throughout the small Chinatown area. High police corruption and the struggle for wealth led to competition for control over the area. A man named Tom Lee, leader of the On Leong Tong, held power until the early 1900s when Sai Wing Mock “Mock Duck” took control of the Hip Sing Tong and began a campaign to overthrow Tom Lee. This began the tong wars that made Doyers Street famous.</p>

      <br><br><div id=theatre></div><p style="font-size:0.8em;font-style:italic;">above: the Chinese Theatre at 5-7 Doyers Street</p><br>
      <p>Doyers Street is also the site of New York City’s first Chinese theater, where Chu Fong ran the Chinese Concert and Theatrical Company. The theater was built on 5-7 Doyers Street in 1880 and quickly assumed a central role in the community. It provided a space for church, school and public local assemblies. Members of rival gangs sat on opposite sides of the theater and kept the peace as performances went on. </p>
      <p>On August 7, 1905, the rival tongs were watching a play called The King’s Daughter at the Chinese Theater. A New York newspaper, The Sun, observed, “There were probably 500 Chinamen in the house and they came from most of the laundries in Manhattan, The Bronx and Jersey City.”</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a Hip Sing gangster lit a string of firecrackers and tossed it onto the stage, creating enough distraction for the rest of the Hip Sing Tong to ambush the On Leongs, killing three men and injuring several others, as well as permanently destroying the theater’s status as an unofficial no man’s land. The assassins likely used the underground tunnels to escape, and no one involved was ever charged with a crime.</p>

      <p>Tensions were still running high in 1909, when a sex slave named Bow Kum (aka Sweet Flower) became the victim of one of the most well-publicized and notorious murder crimes in New York history, setting off another spout of violence between the Hips Sings and On Leongs. Bow Kum was born in 1888 and was brought to America after being sold by her father for just a few dollars. In San Francisco, Low Hee Tong, a man with connections to the Hip Sing Tong and the Four Brothers, purchased Bow Kum for $3,000. When he was arrested and unable to produce a marriage license for her, Bow Kum was taken in by Christian missionaries. Eventually, an On Leong Tong member named Tchin Len married Bow Kum and took her to New York. Furious, Low Hee Tong gathered the Hip Sings and Four Brothers in New York to demand that the On Leongs pay back what he believed was his property and investment. The On Leongs refused. On the night of August 15, 1909, almost exactly four years after the massacre at the Chinese Theater, a Hip Sing hitman snuck into Tchin Len’s home on Mott Street. He stabbed Bow Kum in the heart, slashed her body and cut off her fingers. In the ensuing trial, no one was found guilty.</p><br><br>

          <br>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Later that year, an On Leong member and Chinese comedian named Ah Hoon was murdered. He was known for making playful jabs at enemy tongs onstage. This was apparently not taken well by his rivals, who put up notices declaring that Ah Hoon would be murdered by December 30th that year. Ah Hoon took the threats seriously, and when he performed at the Chinese Theater on the night of December 30th, he ensured there was a police presence nearby and escaped through a tunnel to a boarding house guarded by On Leong members. Still, he was found murdered the next day in his room. It is said that a rival tong member was lowered from the roof on a boatswain’s chair to the window of Ah Hoon’s room and murdered the actor with a silencer. It is unclear which tong was responsible for the act. </p>
          <p>By one account, On Leongs only used Smith & Wesson guns, while Hip Sings only used Colts, making it easy to tell which tong was responsible for each murder. However, it was the hatchet that helped immortalize the 1909 Tong War and the name of “The Bloody Angle.”</p>
        </div>

      <br>
      <p>Men carrying hatchets would wait around one side of the angled street until their victims blindly turned the corner, at which point they would quickly attack and escape via the nearby tunnels, leaving the cobblestone street streaked red with blood. Some believe this is where the term “hatchet man” originated. </p>
      <p>The heavy violence meant both sides of the war were losing money due to the decrease in customers who frequented the gambling and opium dens on the street. Eventually, Mock Duck was arrested in 1912, and with interference from the U.S. and Chinese governments, the tongs brokered an uneasy peace deal in 1913. A smaller war broke out again in 1924, but nothing to the scale of the first war took place again.</p>
      <p>After the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which abolished the national origins based quota system on immigration, Chinatown’s population began to increase rapidly. Around this time, an immigrant from Hong Kong named Nicky Louie ran the Ghost Shadows, a gang that wrestled control of the territory from the On Leongs in a bloody battle after which the On Leongs fully supported the Ghost Shadows, including them in their business dealings. </p>
      <p>The 1980’s in New York marked an unprecedented decade of drug addiction and violence, with a peak in annual homicide rates and the rise of the crack-cocaine epidemic. During this time, the Ghost Shadows and the On Leongs operated gambling houses along Mott Street and ran a protection racket in which shopkeepers paid the gangs a negotiated cash fee for protection. A young Chinese gang called the Flying Dragons (largely controlled by members of the now century-old Hip Sing Tong) also made headlines when fighting with a newly emerged Cantonese-speaking Vietnamese gang called BTK (Born To Kill), mostly formed from immigrants who moved to New York during the Vietnam War. </p>
      <p>In October 1988, “gunmen from the BTK killed two Flying Dragons, reportedly for trying to encroach on their territory,” according to the New York Times. No arrests were made. During summer of the same year, a group of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam threw a bomb loaded with .22-caliber bullets at a police car on Canal Street in retaliation for the arrest of several local merchants for selling counterfeit Rolex watches. </p>
      <p>In an New York Times article, Robert M. Stutman, the head of the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, stated: </p>
      <p style="display:inline-block;margin-left:4em;">The Chinese move into heroin, replacing traditional Sicilian organized-crime families, has happened quickly. . . In 1983, Chinese dealers accounted for only 3 percent of the supply in the city. They now provide 75 percent.</p>
      <p>However, by 1994, Doyers Streets and its neighboring streets Pell, Mott, and Bayard had fallen quiet. The current Hip Sing Leader and “Godfather of Chinatown” Benny Ong reportedly had taken on a legitimate business practice and bought a house in Long Island, where he spent his later years in declining health. Law enforcement cracked down on illegal gambling dens and drug dealing, leaving little turf and business interests to fight over, and the region around Doyers Street gradually became the quiet, unassuming neighborhood of modern times.</p>
