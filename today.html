          <div><p style="padding-top: 10vh;">I visited several times during my few weeks with this project, and each time I walked down Doyers Street, I grasped a bit more of its history and how it has changed. The entrance to Chatham Street starts at Chatham Square in Manhattan Chinatown, but if you visit the Wing Fat Mansion at 7 Chatham Square, you can take the staircase down into what used to be one of the tunnels connected to 5 Doyers Street (where the Chinese Theatre was). The end of the tunnel that used to come up onto Doyers Street is now completely blocked off, but I've heard that in the 70's, a couple of the tunnels were still functional.</p>
          <p>Going down into the tunnel today, there is not much to see. A narrow and dingy LED-lit passageway leads from the stairs to a dead-end where the exit used to be and is flanked by businesses on each side, such as doctors and lawyers offices as well as Tin Sun Metaphysics Feng Shui Life Reading. </p></div>

        <p>1st Doyers Street was at one time H. Zang Milk Depot. Today, the space is occupied by Tasty Hand-pulled Noodles (which gets good reviews)! Across from 1st Doyers was Doyer's distillery, which is now the ugliest U.S. post office in existence. Now, the outdoor seating tents due to COVID-19 obstruct half of the street, making it difficult to get a clear view down the center of Doyers.</p>

        <p>When you turn around the first corner of Doyers Street by the post office, you can see a straighter view similar to the one above from 1900's. 3 Doyers Street was Wing Sing Restaurant, which is now Taiwan Pork Chop House. Where the Chinese Theatre was at 5-7 Doyers is now a string of restaurants which now seem to be closed due to COVID-19, including the Chinese Tuxedo, which existed at another location on Doyers Street in the 1900s and was reopened as a contemporary Chinese restaurant in 2016. At the end of the stretch, 11-13 Doyers Street was the Mandarin Tea Garden. In 1920, Nom Wah Tea Parlor replaced Mandarin Tea Garden, becoming the first dim sum restaurant in New York City. It is the only original business on Doyers Street from the early 20th century still standing.</p>

          </div>
            <div style="width: 30vw;"><p style="padding-top: 5vh;">In a past life, 9 Doyers Street was a Chinese and Japanese silk goods store, as indicated by the sign above. Later, it became the Gold Flower Restaurant, which was a karaoke lounge that closed in 2007.</p>
            <p>Today, a little chemist sign marks Apotheke, an apothecary-themed bar that opened in 2008 to the dismay of many locals who felt that the bar's opening was a sign of gentrification overtaking Chinatown. In this upscale bar, mixologists dressed as pharmacists mix drinks using chemistry beakers and pharmacy scales and sell them for $16-18 each. It is closed now due to COVID-19.</p>
            <p>Turning the main bend and walking down the street towards its intersection with Pell street, there is a string of barber shops and hairdressers, reflecting the street's new nickname, Barber's Alley. Below, you can see that Wing Kee restaurant at 16A Doyers is now Yi Fa Hair Salon.</p>
            <p>At the end of Doyers Streets stands tiny gift shop, painted bright red and filled with various paraphenelia such as Chinese dolls, tricks and traps, fans, backscratchers, stautes, and more. This location was once a gambling den ruled by the On Leong Tong gang. It then became Ming’s Toy Shop (shown in the sketch below) before finally becoming Ting’s Gift Shop in 1957. In 1958 it was busted for drug trafficking when police raided it to find over 1 million USD worth of heroin. </p></div>

          <p>Visitng Doyers Street today, I am struck by how obviously COVID-19 has impacted the business there. Shopkeepers wearing masks are waiting outside the stores for customers more often than not. Inside, plastic sheets hang from the ceilings to sepeerate customers who do come in. The restaurants all have outdoor seating, but unless it is a weekend afternoon, the street is pretty quiet. Ting's was the first place I visited on Doyers. When I first came in, the owners seemed confused as to why I was there. The room was tiny and jam-packed full of trickets, toys, and various items. The middle-aged owner waited by the door and watched as I looked around, while an elderly woman sat behind the counter reading a Chinese newspaper. The owner stiffly but politely declined my request to ask questions about the shop. It seemed like she frequently had to answer questions like mine. Later, I frequently saw the elderly woman waiting for customers outside the shop, sweeping the sidewalk with an old broom.</p>

          <p>I also had the opportunity to speak with a woman who had grown up as a frequent visitor of Chinatown. Her name is Laurie Gwen Shapiro, and I found her on Facebook after she posted about supporting Ting's. She sais that in the earlier days of COVID, the street had gone absolutely silent, and the businesses were struggling. Now, the restrictions are gradually opening up, but she is still very worried about the future of small businesses in Chinatown, particularly Ting's, which she has fond memories of. She tries her best to support her local Chinese stores and restaurants.</p>
          <p>Laurie grew up in a non-religious Jewish family, and has memories of eating Chinese restaurants on the weekends and Christmas. Back then, Chinatown was much smaller: only Pells, Doyers, Mott, and Mosco made up the area. </p>
